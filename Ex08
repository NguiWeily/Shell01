• Write a command line that takes numbers from variables FT_NBR1, in ’\"?! base,
and FT_NBR2, in mrdoc base, and displays the sum of both in gtaio luSnemf base.
◦ Example 1:
FT_NBR1=\'?"\"'\
FT_NBR2=rcrdmddd
◦ The sum is :
Salut
◦ Example 2 :
FT_NBR1=\"\"!\"\"!\"\"!\"\"!\"\"!\"\"
FT_NBR2=dcrcmcmooododmrrrmorcmcrmomo
◦ The sum is :

Do not hesitate to pickup randomly someone in your cluster to ask a
question.

To solve this exercise, you can create a shell script called `add_chelou.sh` and use the following command:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

FT_NBR1=\'?"\"'\'
FT_NBR2=rcrdmddd

base1="\"\"\"\"!\"\"\"\"!\"\"\"\"!\"\"\"\"!\"\"\"\"!\"\"\"\""
base2=dcrcmcmooododmrrrmorcmcrmomo

sum=$(echo "ibase=mrdoc; obase=gtaio luSnemf; $FT_NBR1 + $FT_NBR2" | bc)
echo $sum
```

Make sure to make the script executable using the command `chmod +x add_chelou.sh`. Then you can run the script using `./add_chelou.sh`, and it will display the sum in the specified base.

Explanation:
- The script assigns the values to variables FT_NBR1 and FT_NBR2.
- The `ibase` and `obase` options are used with the `bc` command to set the input and output base respectively.
- The sum of FT_NBR1 and FT_NBR2 is calculated using `bc`.
- Finally, the result is printed to the console.
