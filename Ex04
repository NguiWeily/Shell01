Write a command line that displays your machineâ€™s MAC addresses. Each address

must be followed by a line break.

To display the MAC addresses of your machine, you can use the `ifconfig` command (or `ip` command, depending on your system). Here's the command:

```bash

ifconfig | grep -o -E '([0-9A-Fa-f]{2}:){5}[0-9A-Fa-f]{2}'

```

Let's break down the command:

- `ifconfig`: This command displays network interface information, including MAC addresses.

- `grep -o -E '([0-9A-Fa-f]{2}:){5}[0-9A-Fa-f]{2}'`: The `grep` command with the `-o` option is used to extract the matching MAC address pattern.

  - `([0-9A-Fa-f]{2}:){5}`: This matches a group of six pairs of hexadecimal digits followed by a colon. This represents the first 5 pairs of digits in the MAC address.

  - `[0-9A-Fa-f]{2}`: This matches the last pair of hexadecimal digits in the MAC address.

  - The overall pattern matches a complete MAC address.

When you run this command, it will display the MAC addresses of your machine, with each address on a separate line.
