Create a file containing only "42", and NOTHING else.

• Its name will be :

"\?$*'MaRViN'*$?\"

• Example :

$>ls -lRa *MaRV* | cat -e

-rw---xr-- 1 75355 32015 2 Oct 2 12:21 "\?$*'MaRViN'*$?\"$

$>

To create a file named "\?$*'MaRViN'*$?\" containing only the string "42" and nothing else, you can use the following command:

```bash

echo "42" > "\\\?\$*'MaRViN'*\$?\\"

```

This command uses the `echo` command to write the string "42" to the specified file. The file name is escaped with backslashes to handle special characters.

After running the command, you can verify the file's existence and contents using the `ls` command:

```bash

ls -lRa *MaRV* | cat -e

```

This command will display the file's details, including its name, size, permissions, and modification date. The output will be similar to the example you provided.
