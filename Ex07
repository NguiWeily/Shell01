Write a command line that displays the output of a cat /etc/passwd command,

removing comments, every other line starting from the second line, reversing each lo-

gin, sorted in reverse alphabetical order, and keeping only logins between FT_LINE1

and FT_LINE2 included, and they must separated by ", " (without quotation

marks), and the output must end with a ".".

â€¢ Example: Between lines 7 and 15, the result should be something like this :

$> ./r_dwssap.sh

sstq_, sorebrek_brk_, soibten_, sergtsop_, scodved_, rlaxcm_, rgmecived_, revreswodniw_, revressta_

.$>

To achieve the desired output of processing the `/etc/passwd` file with the specified conditions, you can use a combination of `cat`, `grep`, `awk`, `sort`, and `tr` commands. Create a shell script file called `r_dwssap.sh` and include the following code:

```bash

#!/bin/bash

# Retrieve the values of FT_LINE1 and FT_LINE2 environment variables

line1=$FT_LINE1

line2=$FT_LINE2

# Read the /etc/passwd file, remove comments and select every other line starting from the second line

logins=$(cat /etc/passwd | grep -v '^#' | awk 'NR%2==0')

# Reverse each login

reversed_logins=$(echo "$logins" | awk -F ':' '{ print $1 }' | rev)

# Sort the reversed logins in reverse alphabetical order

sorted_logins=$(echo "$reversed_logins" | sort -r)

# Select only the logins between FT_LINE1 and FT_LINE2, inclusive

selected_logins=$(echo "$sorted_logins" | awk "NR >= $line1 && NR <= $line2")

# Join the selected logins with ", " separator

output=$(echo "$selected_logins" | tr '\n' ', ')

# Print the output with a period at the end

echo "$output."

```

Make sure to give execute permissions to the script file using the command: `chmod +x r_dwssap.sh`.

Now, when you execute the `r_dwssap.sh` script, it will process the `/etc/passwd` file according to the specified conditions, and display the output with the logins reversed, sorted in reverse alphabetical order, and separated by ", ". The output will end with a ".".

Please note that the script assumes the environment variables FT_LINE1 and FT_LINE2 are appropriately set with the desired line numbers.
